I must say that shooting with Jencus was quite an eye-opener, and really cool at the same time.

I've never seen someone working with so many strobes and flashes at one go - to be precise, 3 strobes and 4-5 flashes. All of the flashes were precisely controlled with circular honey comb/coloured gels/narrow zooms/etc/etc. 

I'm not saying it's bad to just go with one main light, diffused with a giant softbox. However, understanding the technicalities of light and knowing what you want to light up/eliminate sometimes requires one to go with more complicated light setups.

Of course, such an endeavour requires much patience and experience.
