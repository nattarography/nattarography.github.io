I admit, this is a super backdated post. It was shot about 6 months ago.
Probably one of the first few shoots I attempted playing with smoke cakes. There's always a first time for everything - I used too much smoke cake and created a cloud too thick that we couldn't see much for awhile.

In case you were wondering about my lighting setup:

1. a red-gelled flash was put behind the smoke (smoke is whitish-grey color initially)

2. A 80x80cm softbox to the right of the picture to light up the subject
